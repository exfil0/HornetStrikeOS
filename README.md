- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):**
  - User roles restrict access to critical system functions.
- **Secure Data Storage:**
  - AES-256 encrypted databases for intercepted data and logs.
  - Secure retention and auditable logs for evidentiary purposes.
- **Tasks:**
  - [ ] Implement AES-256 encryption for logs & captured data
  - [ ] Design Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
  - [ ] Configure signed event logging
  - [ ] Ensure logs comply with **ETSI & CALEA regulations**

- **Tasks:**
  - [ ] Develop CLI-based operator dashboard
  - [ ] Integrate **Web UI for remote monitoring**
  - [ ] Implement **real-time spectrum visualization**
  - [ ] Connect UI with interception database

## **7. Networking & Remote Operations**
- **Stealth Mode:** Minimal network footprint for covert operations.
